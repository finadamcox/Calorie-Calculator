Django project – Calorie Calculator

<h2> What is a Calorie Calculator? </h2>
”Health is wealth” Obviously, you have heard it a thousand times but as we grow older we often realize it’s true and this app provides an interesting way to get started with the very boring term “dieting” as we already know “FITNESS START WITH WHAT WE EAT”.

### This Calorie Calculator is an interesting project –  to record and estimate number of calories we need to consume daily. This app can also provide guidelines for gaining or losing weight.
